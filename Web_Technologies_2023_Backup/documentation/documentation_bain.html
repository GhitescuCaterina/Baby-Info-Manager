                        The BaIn (Baby Info Manager) web application allows authenticated users, such as families or couples, to manage resources related to the care of a child from infancy to puberty. The application offers features such as a calendar for feeding and sleeping hours, multimedia resources like photos, films, and audio recordings that capture the child's growth and development, medical history, and records of their relationship with other children, such as cousins or kindergarten/school colleagues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application provides a chronological view of the most important captured moments related to each individual child. This timeline feature allows parents or guardians to easily track and review their child's milestones and growth over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This web application is designed to improve the experience of caring for children by allowing users to have all the resources and information related to childcare in one organized and easily accessible place. In addition, the application provides an easy way to share this information with other family members or close friends by either tagging them in various multimedia resources, or by sharing important moments through a social application or an RSS news feed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal of this application is to provide a complete solution for managing resources related to childcare, so that users can be more organized and efficient in managing their childcare responsibilities. This application can be a useful tool for parents, grandparents, tutors, or anyone else who has childcare responsibilities.

                        The BaIn web application is designed to allow authenticated users to manage resources related to the care of a child from infancy to puberty. The major functions of the application include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The application allows users to create a parent/tutor account with some basic personal information regarding their e-mail, last name, first name, date of birth and password (the latter must be confirmed by introducing it twice).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any user that has an account can log in to the application using their e-mail and password.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For every account created, a unique reference code is generated, which can be used to invite other users to acces the data regarding the initial user's children.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any user that has an account can view a list of all the users that they have invited to view their children's profiles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any user that has an account can delete it, as a consequence, all the data related to their children will be deleted too.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any user that is logged in can create profiles for their children, which will be stored in the database.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When creating the profile of a child, a user needs to provide a picture of the child, the first and last name of the child, a username (which is unique), the date of birth and the gender that their child has.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Any user that has created the profile of one or more children can view, edit or delete those specific profiles.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                    <h3><span>2.3</span> User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
                    <p>
                        The two main user classes of the BaIn web application relate mainly to how one person has access to the account of a child, therefore there are the parents (the people that create the account of a child) and the tutors (the people that can have access to a child's account).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The parents are the ones that have the most privileges, as they can create, edit and delete the profiles of their children. The parents can invite other users to view the profiles of their children and they can see a list of people that have access to seeing their children’s profiles. The parents can also create the profiles of their children by just importing a CSV or JSON file that contains the required information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The tutors are the ones that are invited to view the profiles of the children of other users. The tutors can modify the profiles of the children they have access to, but they can not delete them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Both the parents and the tutors can create a personal account, log in to the application and delete their accounts. They can also export the multimedia resources and information related to their children in a CSV or JSON file, or share the most important moments related to their children/the children they have access to through a social application or an RSS news feed. Both types of users can tag the profiles of other users' children when adding multimedia resources or other information to the profiles of the children. They have access to a list of all the children’s profiles that they created/are alloowed to see. They can also view a chronological timeline of the most important captured moments related to the children they have access to.

                        In order to function at its maximum potential, the BaIn web application needs to be connected to the internet, as it uses an external database to store the information related to the profiles of the children. The application also needs to be connected to the internet in order to be able to share the most important moments related to the children through a social application or an RSS news feed. The application, therefore, depends on the internet connection in order to function properly.

                        No external hardware is required in order to use the BaIn web application, as it can be used on any device that has an internet connection and a web browser installed.
